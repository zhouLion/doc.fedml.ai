# Job YAML

## Minimalist `Job.yaml`

```yaml title="job.yaml"
# Local directory where your source code resides.
# It should be the relative path to this job yaml file.
# If your job doesn't contain any source code, it can be empty.
workspace: hello_world

# Bootstrap shell commands which will be executed before running entry commands.
# Support multiple lines, which can be empty.
bootstrap: |
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  echo "Bootstrap finished."

# Running entry commands which will be executed as the job entry point.
# If an error occurs, you should exit with a non-zero code, e.g. exit 1.
# Otherwise, you should exit with a zero code, e.g. exit 0.
# Support multiple lines, which can not be empty.
job: |
    echo "Hello, Here is the launch platform."
    echo "Current directory is as follows."
    pwd
    python hello_world.py
  
computing:
  minimum_num_gpus: 1      # minimum # of GPUs to provision
  # max cost per hour of all machines for your job.
  # E.g., if your job are assigned 2 x A100 nodes (8 GPUs), each GPU cost $1/GPU/Hour, "maximum_cost_per_hour" = 16 * $1 = $16
  maximum_cost_per_hour: $1.75
```

:::tip Tip
For most cases, you just need to use the above minimalist `job.yaml` with following four properties:
1. `workspace`, It is the local directory where your source code resides.
2. `job`,  It is the running entry command which will be executed as the job entry point.
3. `bootstrap`, It is the bootstrap shell command which will be executed before running entry commands.
4. `computing`, It is the computing resource configuration for your job.

## Fully loaded `Job.yaml`

Below is `job.yaml` loaded with all properties. You can use it as a reference to create your own `job.yaml` tailored to your specific needs.

```yaml title="job.yaml"
