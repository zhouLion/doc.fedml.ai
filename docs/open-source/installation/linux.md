# Linux

A step-by-step installation guide of FedML on Linux.

## Ubuntu 

On Ubuntu, run the following commands to install `pip3` and `fedml`, and check environment info:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install fedml
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
fedml env
```

## CentOS
On CentOS, run the following commands to install `pip3` and `fedml`, and check environment info:
```
yum –y install python3-pip
pip3 install fedml
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
fedml env
```

<!-- ## Running FedML on Kubernetes

This tutorial will guide you to deploy your fedml client and server to target Kubernetes pods running on GPU/CPU physical nodes.

The entire workflow is as follows:

(k8s deployment file is located in: [https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/installation/install_on_k8s/fedml-edge-client-server](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples))
1. In the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value
2. Deploy the fedml client:  ```kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-client.yml```
3. In the file fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml, modify the variable ACCOUNT_ID to your desired value
4. Deploy the fedml server:  ```kubectl apply -f ./fedml-edge-client-server/deployment-server.yml```
5. Login the FedML MLOps platform (https://fedml.ai), the above deployed client and server will be found in the edge devices

If you want to scale up or scal down the pods to your desired count, you may run the following command:

```kubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment```

```kubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment```

## Installation with Helm Charts

Also, you may use the helm charts to deploy your fedml client and server to target Kubernetes cluster.
You just need to run the following commands with your user id at the fedml.ai.
```
kubectl create namespace fedml
helm install --set image.repository="fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light" --set env.fedmlAccountId="$YourUserId" --set env.role="client" fedml-client-deployment ./fedml-client-deployment-latest.tgz
helm install --set image.repository="fedml/fedml-edge-client-server-light" --set env.fedmlAccountId="$YourUserId" --set env.role="server" fedml-server-deployment ./fedml-server-deployment-latest.tgz
```

# Q&A

1. Q: How to scale up or scale down?  
   A: Use the following commands:

```kubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-client-deployment```

```kubectl scale -n $YourNameSpace --replicas=$YourDesiredPodsCount deployment/fedml-server-deployment```

2. Q: FedML Client send online status to FedML Server via which protocol?  
   A: Via MQTT


3. Q: FedML Client send model, gradient parameters to FedML Server via which protocol?  
   A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models and use MQTT to exchange messages between FedML Client and Server


4. Q: Why do we need AWS S3?  
   A: Use S3 protocol to store and exchange models.
