### `fedml launch [OPTIONS] YAML_FILE`

Launch jobs on the FedML® Launch platform (fedml.ai).

#### Options

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                                                 |

#### Notes

Before launching any job, first, you need to define your job properties in the job yaml file, e.g. entry file, config file, command arguments, etc. The job yaml file is as follows:

```
fedml_env:
  project_name:

# Local directory where your source code resides.
# It should be the relative path to this job yaml file or the absolute path.
# If your job doesn't contain any source code, it can be empty.
workspace: hello_world

# Running entry commands which will be executed as the job entry point.
# If an error occurs, you should exit with a non-zero code, e.g. exit 1.
# Otherwise, you should exit with a zero code, e.g. exit 0.
# Support multiple lines, which can not be empty.
job: |
    echo "Hello, Here is the launch platform."
    echo "Current directory is as follows."
    pwd
    python hello_world.py

# Bootstrap shell commands which will be executed before running entry commands.
# Support multiple lines, which can be empty.
bootstrap: |
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  echo "Bootstrap finished."

computing:
  minimum_num_gpus: 1             # minimum # of GPUs to provision

  # max cost per hour of all machines for your job.
  # E.g., if your job are assigned 2 x A100 nodes (8 GPUs), each GPU cost $1/GPU/Hour, "maximum_cost_per_hour" = 16 * $1 = $16
  maximum_cost_per_hour: $1.75

  allow_cross_cloud_resources: false # true, false
  device_type: GPU              # options: GPU, CPU, hybrid
  resource_type: A100-80G       # e.g., A100-80G, please check the resource type list by "fedml show-resource-type" or visiting URL: https://fedml.ai/accelerator_resource_type

framework_type: fedml         # options: fedml, deepspeed, pytorch, general
task_type: train              # options: serve, train, dev-environment

# Running entry commands on the server side which will be executed as the job entry point.
# Support multiple lines, which can not be empty.
server_job: |
    echo "Hello, Here is the server job."
    echo "Current directory is as follows."
    pwd
```


You just need to customize the following config items:

1. `workspace`, this is the local directory where your source code resides.

2. `job`, this is the running entry command which will be executed as the job entry point.

3. `bootstrap`, this is the bootstrap shell command which will be executed before running entry commands.

Then you can use the following example CLI to launch the job at the MLOps platform.
(Replace `$YourApiKey` with your own account API key from fedml.ai)

#### Example: Launch job on FedML® Launch platform
 

```
fedml launch hello_job.yaml
```

:::info 
Note that you might be prompted for **API_KEY** the first time you run the command. Please get this key from your account on FedML AI Nexus Platform. You can also specify the API_KEY with the `-k` option.
:::


After the launch CLI is executed, you will get the following output prompting for confirmation of resources:

You can either confirm through terminal or may even open the run url to confirm.
Once resources are confirmed, it will then run your job and you will get the following output:
