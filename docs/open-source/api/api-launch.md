# FEDML Launch APIs

Simple launcher apis for running any AI job across multiple public and/or decentralized GPU clouds, offering lower prices without cloud vendor lock-in, the highest GPU availability, training across distributed low-end GPUs, and user-friendly Ops to save time on environment setup.


:::tip
Before using some of the apis that require remote operation (e.g. `fedml.api.launch_job()`), please use one of the following methods to login 
to FedML MLOps platform first:

(1) CLI: `fedml login $api_key`

(2) API: `fedml.api.fedml_login(api_key=$api_key)`
:::


### `fedml.api.launch_job()`

Launch a job on the FedML AI Nexus platform

```py
fedml.api.launch_job(yaml_file, api_key=None, resource_id=None, device_server=None, device_edges=None)
```

**Arguments**  
- `yaml_file (str)`: Full path of your job yaml file.
- `api_key (str=None)`: Your API key from FedML AI Nexus platform (if not configured already).
- `resource_id (str=None)`: Specific `resource_id` to use. Typically, you won't need to specify a specific `resource_id`. Instead, we will match resources based on your job yaml, and then automatically launch the job using matched resources.
- `device_server (str=None)`: `device_server` to use. Only needed when you want to launch a federated learning job with specific `device_server` and `device_edges`
- `device_edges (List[str]=None): List of `device_edges` to use. Only needed when you want to launch a federated learning job with specific `device_server` and `device_edges`

**Returns**  
`LaunchResult` object with the following attributes:
- `result_code (int)`: API result code. `0` means success. Full list of result codes can be found [here](#result-codes).
- `result_msg (str)`: API status message.
- `run_id (str)`: Run ID of the launched job.
- `project_id (str)`: Project Id of the launched job. This is default assigned if not specified in your job yaml file
- `inner_id (str)`: Serving endpoint id of launched job. Only applicable for Deploy / Serve Job tasks, and will be `None` otherwise. 


**Example**

```py
import fedml
api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
yaml_file = "/home/fedml/train.yaml"
login_ret = fedml.api.fedml_login(api_key)
if login_ret == 0:
    launch_result = fedml.api.launch_job(yaml_file)
    if launch_result.result_code == 0:
        print("Job launched successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to launch job")
```


### `fedml.api.launch_job_on_cluster()`

```py
import fedml
api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
yaml_file = "/home/fedml/train.yaml"
login_ret = fedml.api.fedml_login(api_key)
