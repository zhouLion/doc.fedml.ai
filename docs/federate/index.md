# What is FEDML Federate?


FedML®Federate is part of FEDML® Nexus AI cloud. It is a machine learning platform that enables zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning and analytics. It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various users/silos/edge nodes without requiring data centralization to the cloud, thus providing maximum privacy and efficiency. It consists of a lightweight and cross-platform Edge AI SDK that is deployable over edge GPUs, smartphones, and IoT devices. Furthermore, it also provides a user-friendly MLOps platform to simplify decentralized machine learning and real-world deployment. FedML supports vertical solutions across a broad range of industries (healthcare, finance, insurance, smart cities, IoT, etc.) and applications (computer vision, natural language processing, data mining, and time-series forecasting). Its core technology is backed by many years of cutting-edge research by its co-founders.
