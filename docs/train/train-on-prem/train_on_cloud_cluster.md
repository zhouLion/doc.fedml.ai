# Train on Your Own Cloud GPU cluster

## Setup the FEDML library

Install Python library for interacting with FedML® Launch APIs.
```
pip install fedml
```

## Create job.yaml file

Before launch any job, at first, you need to define your job properties in the job yaml file, e.g. workspace, job, bootstrap, etc.

The workspace folder is the folder where your source code for execution resides

Below is an example of job yaml file:

```
fedml_env:
  project_name: my-project
  
# Local directory where your source code resides.
# It should be the relative path to this job yaml file.
# If your job doesn't contain any source code, it can be empty.


workspace: hello_world

# Bootstrap shell commands which will be executed before running entry commands.
# Support multiple lines, which can be empty.
bootstrap: |
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  echo "Bootstrap finished."


# Running entry commands which will be executed as the job entry point.
# If an error occurs, you should exit with a non-zero code, e.g. exit 1.
# Otherwise, you should exit with a zero code, e.g. exit 0.
# Support multiple lines, which can not be empty.
job: |
    echo "Hello, Here is the launch platform."
    echo "Current directory is as follows."
    pwd
    python hello_world.py
  

computing:
  minimum_num_gpus: 1      # minimum # of GPUs to provision
  # max cost per hour of all machines for your job.
  # E.g., if your job are assigned 2 x A100 nodes (8 GPUs), each GPU cost $1/GPU/Hour, "maximum_cost_per_hour" = 16 * $1 = $16
  maximum_cost_per_hour: $1.75
  resource_type: A100-80G       # e.g., A100-80G, please check the resource type list by "fedml show-resource-type" or visiting URL: https://fedml.ai
  
```

## Launch a job on a cluster cloud

NOTE: Note that you might be prompted for API_KEY the first time you run the command. Please get this key from your account on FedML® AI Nexus Platform. You can also specify the API_KEY with the -k option.

```
fedml launch /path/to/job.yaml -c my_cluster
```

NOTE: If a cluster with the specified name does not exist, a new one will be created for you (provided the required resources are both available and matched for your request). Once the cluster is established, the resources will remain locked in for this cluster till you tear the cluster down and will be utilized for any subsequent tasks initiated under the same cluster name.

After the launch CLI is executed, you will get the following output prompting for confirmation of resources:

Searched and matched the following GPU resource for your job:
+-----------+-------------------+---------+------------+-------------------------+---------+------+----------+

You can also view the matched GPU resource with Web UI at:

Do you want to launch the job with the above matched GPU resource? [y/N]:
```

You can either confirm through terminal or may even open the run url to confirm. Once resources are confirmed, it will then create a cluster out of these matched resources, run your job, and you will get the following output:

```

## Run concurrent jobs on cluster

You can run as many consequent jobs as you like on your cluster now. It will queue the jobs and by default run in the order of submission.
